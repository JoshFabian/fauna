      %h4 Terms of Service - Last Updated 6/24/14

      %p Our community has terms of service (TOS) to protect both us as a business and you as a user on our web sites.  This site is monitored by both users like you as well as staff to ensure that all rules are abided by and enforced.  

      %p Rules on the fauna.net  are in place for a number of reasons, and on occasion new rules are added and old rules changed or eliminated. 

      %p To post ads using a business name you understand and are agreeing that you have the legal rights to that name, which is subject to verification by our staff.  This account is a legally binding contract between Fauna, Inc. and either an individual person or a legal business entity.  Only one account is allowed per business or individual.  Accounts registered under a business name are considered business accounts. If the account is registered under a business name, the owner of the business must be listed in the registration.  As a definition, a “listing” or “advertisement” as discussed in this contract represents a animal that is being posted for sale by a registered Fauna.net member.  No refunds will be granted under any circumstances.  You may only post listings for yourself or your business, depending on your account registration.  All listings posted with an individual account must be posted in the name of the individual that registered the account.  All listings posted with a business account must be posted in the name of the business.  All listings posted with under a business name, must be with a legally registered business name, registered with the appropriate state and/or federal agencies.  If an employee will be posting listings, they must post advertisements for the business not for individuals or employees of the business.  You may not post listings for other businesses other than the business name the account is established under, regardless of whether you own all or part of those other businesses. You will need a separate account for each business entity.  You may not post advertisements for other individuals, regardless of whether they are friends, relatives or family members.  

      %p Businesses  and users are responsible for their own listings,, as well as any and all complaints or legal issues arising from them.  A Fauna account is a service contract established in the name of a SINGLE ENTITY. If more than one (1) person is found to be using a single account without prior permission, or that listings for more than one (1) individual or business are being posted using a single account, that account will be terminated without notice or warning and no refunds.  Anyone found violating this rule is committing Theft of Service and may be prosecuted as such.

      %p Terms and rules are in place for everyone's protection and to meet legal requirements.   Our goal is to make the website usable and accessible to as many people and business as possible while maintaining a safe and useful community for all parties involved.  If you have any questions before posting please contact support@fauna.net.  Fauna, Inc., owners of fauna.net, reserve the right to update and change these terms of service without prior notice.
